Activity 1 
___________________

Initilize String called stringPhrase = " "

print "enter a phrase"
stringPhrase = User input

Convert stringPhrase into a character array called Phrase

For each character in Phrase
  if character is not space or null or already capitalized
    char-=32
  else if character = space or already capitalized
    nothing
  else 
    end for statement.

Print new Phrase

Activity 2
___________________

Initilize int array Num = 2

Initilize int holder
initilize int x = 0

while x<2 
  holder = user input

  if holder != int 
    "Re input an int"
     x-=1
  else
    Num(x) = holder

  x+=1
//end of while loop

Holder = Num(0) + Num(1)
print holder 


Activity 3
________________
Initilize int Num 

Initilize int holder
initilize bool continue = true

initilize character userContine

//While loop to get User's Input
while continue == true 
  holder = user input

  if holder != int 
    "Re input an int"

  // Ask User if they want to continue
  print "do you want to continue? Y/N"

  if userContinue != Y
    continue = False
  
//end of while loop

print Num


Activity 4
_____________________
Initilize maxNum=0
Initilize bool continue = true
Initilize char userChoice = Y

While continue = True
  Initilize int randNum = 0

  print "Set max Number"
  maxNumber = user input (as long as it is an Int) Else User is forced to re input a int.

  randNum = a random number between 0 and max Number (inclusive)

  print randNum 

  print Would you like to continue? Y/N
  userChoice = user input
  if userChoice != Y
    continue = false

//End of While Loop


Activity 5
____________________
Initilize an int called counter = 0
Initilize an int called randNum = 0
Initilize an int called leftCount = 0
Initilize an int called rightCount = 0

While counter < 10

  randNum = a random number (exclude 0)
  randNum = randNum % 2
  
  if randNum=0
    print "RIGHT"
    rightCount += 1
  else
    print "LEFT"
    leftCount += 1

//End of While Loop
